# react-tkinter

Take a look at `tkintertest.py`. That is a little cumbersome, don't you think?

Now take a look at `test.py`. Much better.

## Installation
The project is not released on pypi yet as the author is facing account issues.
```
pip install react-tkinter
```
Requires Python 3.7 or higher, probably.
